Recommended Model Architecture for RoboCar
Based on the project requirements in the subject.md file and the specific nature of the racing simulator task, I recommend the MultiInputModel architecture with CNN components.

Why MultiInputModel is Ideal:
Handles Different Input Types Separately:

Raycast sensor data (spatial information about track boundaries)
Vehicle state data (speed, position)
These fundamentally different data types benefit from specialized processing branches.

Spatial Understanding:

The CNN component processes raycast data as a 1D spatial structure
Captures relationships between adjacent rays (crucial for detecting track boundaries)
Recognizes patterns in track geometry
Aligns with Project Requirements:

"Small model with a big dataset is way better than a big model with a small dataset"
MultiInputModel provides sufficient complexity without being overengineered
Simpler than the Hybrid model but more tailored than the SimpleModel
Suitable for Driving Tasks:

Racing requires understanding both the track layout (raycasts) and current car state
Similar architectures have shown success in autonomous driving research
Recommended Implementation:
Input Layer 1: Raycast data → CNN layers → Flattened features
Input Layer 2: Vehicle state → Dense layer
Concatenate both processed inputs
Several Dense layers with appropriate activation functions
Output Layer: Steering and acceleration predictions

This architecture balances complexity with performance while respecting the project's emphasis on data quality over model sophistication.
